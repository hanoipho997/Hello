# VQE_Ising_TFIM
VQE for finding ground state of Ising ring of n spins in transverse magnetic field. 
Caculations in this project are based on method proposed in Section 17 (page 70) from 
Quantum Algorithm Implementations for Beginners https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03719.pdf#cite.2001Natur.414..883V
Equation (96) at page 72 was found to be wrong.
Also, a general anzat, which spans the whole Hilbert space, is introduced.
